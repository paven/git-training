* Commit centered
* SHA everything
* Filesystem storage

often: Often
## Distributed

* The repository is local
* There are multiple repositories
* {{often}} there is a shared remote
* If the remote is down.. You can still work

1. Push - the remote
---
## Edit - the working directory

* The working directory is just like any other directory on you hard drive.
* contains your files
* contains .git
* edit as you like
* edited file are tagged __new/modified__ by git status

???
_Working Directory (Mandatory)_

---
## Add - to index - staged

```bash
git add theFileYouWannaAdd
git add -p theFileYouWannaAdd
```

* Creates new blobs(ie stores file content in .git)
* updates the index
* edited file are tagged __staged__ by git status
* -p allows you to select hunks of code to add from the file(s)

???

_The Index (Mandatory)_
_Interactive Staging (Mandatory)_


---
## Commit - to repository history
```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```
* creates new trees (ie stores the directory in .git)
* creates new commit(ie stores the commit in .git)
* updates HEAD, branch
* removes from index

<!--_Recording Changes to the Repository (Mandatory)_-->
---
## HEAD

pointer to:
* latest of the series(branch?) of commits you are looking at.
* the commit, that the index and working directory is compared to.

HEAD is where your head is!

---
## Commit - the commit

```bash
git cat-file commit HEAD

```
--

* tree - SHA1
* parent - SHA1
* author
* committer
* message

---
## Commit - SHA1

```bash
(printf "commit %s\0" $(git cat-file commit HEAD |
wc -c);
git cat-file commit HEAD) |
sha1sum
```
<!--_Authors and Committers (Mandatory)_-->
---
## Directed acyclic graph (DAG)

# Whats happening?
* log
* show
* diff
* status

---
## Log - history

```bash
git log
git log --oneline --graph
```
---

## Show - history

```bash
git show
git show --name-only
```
---

## Diff - to history

```bash
git diff
git diff --name-only
```
???
lol
---

## Status - what is in progress

```bash
git status
```

# Release tag

* A Tag points to a commit.
* Tags are used to mark releases.  
	* If you are doing continuous delivery, only major releases get tags
* They are tagged with a release name/number.  
	* ie "v1.2"" or "juno".
	* "v1.2-fix-1"" or "juno-fix-1"" or "v1.2.1"

--


* Can be signed.
* Can have a message.
* Tags are not pushed automatically
* Shared tags should __never__ change.

<!-- _Aggregating commits (Mandatory)_ -->
---

## Release tag

lightweight tag
```bash

## When to branch
__+__ Branches are basically a free resource!  
__+__ Allows you to save state of a task!  
__+__ Allows you to track forks!  
__+__ Allows you to share incomplete work

 
--

__Â±__ Branches containing discarded commits will keep them in the repository.  

--
name: whenToBranch

__-__ HEAD keeps track of what you are doing!  
__-__ Unused branches clutters the branch list!  
__-__ When are you going back to that branch?  
__-__ Is there an other way to find that commit?  
 
???
--_Branch Management (Mandatory)_--
---
## Git Flow

* local [(1,2,3)](#phases)
* feature-* [(4?)](#phases)
* develop [(4)](#phases)
* release-* [(4!)](#phases)

* master [(4!!)](#phases)

## Rebase conflict
   
    First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
    Applying: Conflicting commit
    Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
    M	firstFile.txt
    Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
    Auto-merging firstFile.txt
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in firstFile.txt
    Recorded preimage for 'firstFile.txt'
    Failed to merge in the changes.
    Patch failed at 0001 Conflicting commit
    The copy of the patch that failed is found in:
       /home/pvn/git/git2-exercise/.git/rebase-apply/patch
    
    When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
    If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
    To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".
    
---

## Merge Conflict

    Auto-merging firstFolder/secondtFile.txt
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in firstFolder/secondtFile.txt
    Recorded preimage for 'firstFolder/secondtFile.txt'
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

not as informativ/ less cluttered than the rebase messege
```bash
merge --abort
```
---

## Reviewing the conflict
```bash
git status
cat conflictingFile.txt
```
---
## Merge/Rebase conflicts

    some code that is in both
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    this is from head
    =======
    this is from the commit adding to it
    >>>>>>> conflictingCommit
	more code that is in both

# Nested repos - overview

* Submodules
* Subtrees
* alternatives

---

## Submodule

Feature | Submodule | Subtree
--|--|--
part of git | yes | yes
meta data of main repo | no | yes
config part of main repo | yes | no

---
## Submodule

add an existing repo/branch as a submodule
```bash
git submodule add -b submoduleBranch https://git..xercise  module
```
meta information in repo
```bash
cat .gitmodules
ls .git/modules/
```
update an existing submodule
```bash
git submodule update -init
```

clone with submodules
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chaconinc/MainProject
```

???
_Submodules (Mandatory)_
git tracks what version a submodule has.

---
## Subtree merging

easy to split out a new subtree
```bash
git subtree split --prefix=path/to/code -b newSubtreeBranch
```
merge in a subtree
```bash
git subtree add --prefix=path/to/code --squash shared master
```

???
git tracks the files and commits in the repository as "normal commits"
_Subtree Merging (Mandatory)_
---
## Alternative

* don't blend repos!
* use a proper build tool!

but useful for:

* subtree - useful if you meant to extract a library
* both - if you are not using a build tool(ie webpage)

* clean
* reset
* checkout
* commit --amend
* rebase -i
* revert
* push -f


???
_Undoing Things (Mandatory)_
_Revision Selection (Mandatory)_
---
## Stash

moves away your working directory changes, including indexed to a stash
```bash
git stash
```
stashes can be listen
```bash
git stash list
```
the stash can be added back
```bash
git stash pop <stash>
git stash apply <stash>
```

---
## Clean
```bash
git clean -ind	
```
* i - interactive
* n - dry run
* d - directories 
* f - force 
---
## Reset

[!["reset - atlassian"](res/cc-by/atlassian/reset.svg)](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting/commit-level-operations)

---
## Reset
just move the branch pointer
```bash
git reset --soft <commitish>
```
also set the index to match the head
```bash
git reset --mixed <commitish>
```
also set the working directory to match the index
```bash
git reset --hard <commitish>
```
---
## Checkout
* moves head and updates working directory
```bash
git checkout origin/master
git checkout HEAD^
git checkout <commitish>
```
---
## - just a file

reset gets the file and adds it to the index(and WD)
```bash
git reset <commitish> file.txt
```

checkout adds it only to the working directory
```bash
git checkout <commitish> file.txt
```
---

## Revert

* do not change history
* creates an new commit that reverts the old one

```bash
git revert <commitish>
```
---

## commit --amend

Changes the last commit (the one that head points to).

```bash
git commit --amend
```

---
## rebase interactive

lets you change/reorder/drop commits interactively 
```bash
git rebase -i origin/master
```
---

## push -f
 
if you have to break your


# Debugging

### check ignore

why is an file ignored
```bash
